# Comment-toxicity-and-hate-Detection

This program is used to detect toxicity, hate, insults and threats from comments. These comments can be taken from any website like youtube, twitter, facebook and other social media sites. It utilizes a bi-directional LSTM to classify. It is possible to categorize the different classes of toxicity. 
Finally i have performed this for only 1 epoch of training as I cannot use my GPU to train the model, hence the accuracy is pretty low. It is definately possible to improve the accuracy once it is trained for multiple epochs.

the dataset can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

In the future i plan on buiding a proper API that can be placed in websites so that we all can enjoy browsing the internet without being blasted by hate/toxic comments
